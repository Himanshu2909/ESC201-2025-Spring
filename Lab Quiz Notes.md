### Lab 8
##### Operational Amplifiers in Negative Feedback

 For an ideal op-amp, we assume that: 
 1. the open loop differential gain A is infinite
 2. the input impedance is infinite 
 3. the output impedance is zero
making it practically an ideal voltage-controlled voltage source. However, in a practical op amp, the gain A is typically in the range of 104 to 106 over the frequency range of interest considering different IC types.
